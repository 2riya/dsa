Intuition :

Intuitively,
Either curr char from s1 should match curr char of s3 OR curr char of s2 should match curr char of s3

If neither matches, there's no answer

If one matches, call for next char of s3 and check

If both matches, check for both possiblities, i.e., check in both s1 and s2 for next chars


It can be achieved via recursion, such that,
i <- iterator for s1
j <- iterator for s2
k <- iterator for s3
if (s1[i] == s3[k]) solve(i + 1, j, k + 1)
if (s2[j] == s3[k]) solve(i, j + 1, k+ 1)


This can be memoized for i, j and k.

3D Top Down DP:
Boolean dp[i][j][k] <- for storing result of each call

2D Top Down DP:
It can be observed that k will always increment
Also, k will always be equal to (i + j) of current call
This is because i marks the current pos in s1, j marks curr pos in s2
Which means, (i - 1) chars of s1 and (j - 1) chars of s2 have been traversed
Therefore, for s3 also, (i + j - 1) chars should have been traversed by now
Which means k = i + j

Hence, 2D Boolean array, dp[i][j] can be used to memoize recursive calls


2D Bottom Up DP:

Each cell in dp[i][j] represents whether (i - 1) chars of s1 and (j - 1) chars of s2 are able to form (i + j - 1) chars of s3

e.g.:


To determine dp[i][j],
If char from s1 matches, i.e., s1[i] == s3[i + j]
then,
