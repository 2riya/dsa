<b>2 Queues - O(n) Push, O(1) Pop</b>
<br>Maintain 2 queues at class level - q1, q2
<br>One queue will always be empty at any given point of time and that queue will act as temp queue to tranfer contents during push operation
<br>
<br>Diff -
<br>Swap operation isn't required
<br>Additional if empty queue check on pop and top operations
